/**
 * This class defines code used to create Runnable 'tasks' to test the file copy
 * mehods in FileUtil. The subclasses should define their own run() method to
 * perform the actual task.
 * 
 * See the main method for example of how to use this. It uses the Stopwatch and
 * TaskTimer classes from stopwatch project.
 * 
 * All the file copy methods require an input stream (read from file) and an
 * output stream that writes to a file, so this class defines methods to open a
 * file as an InputStream and open an output file as an OutputStream. Files can
 * be opened via the constructor or setInput(filename) and setOutput(filename)
 * methods.
 * 
 * The method to open an InputStream shows how to use the ClassLoader to find a
 * file on the classpath of this project. The classpath includes files in your
 * project's src/ directory. It is a standard technique for opening resources.
